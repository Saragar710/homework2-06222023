## Description

After 20 plus years in the food and beverage industy I decided to take a risk and start a new career. Although the guidelines were given to us, I definitely struggles with this project. I will have to get better at reading the README files. I reached out to a tutor and got help with this assignment. I now understand when you have a bunch of items in a section that you use the article element as well. After images you use and alt element and a clear description of what the image looks like for the visually impaired.  I think that is an amazing idea. For the css file I now understand about repeating code and keeping it dry. Combinding repetitive code makes your code easier to read. This is going to take time and some frustration, but this will be a fasinating new career.
